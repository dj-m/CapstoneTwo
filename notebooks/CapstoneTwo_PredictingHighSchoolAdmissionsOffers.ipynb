    "## Predicting Test Performance for Specialised High School Admissions ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance on the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT) determines eligibility to one of the eight specialized high schools in New York City. It is administered by the New York City Department of Education (DOE) to about a third of the city’s 8th graders, with 5,000 receiving admissions offers. Of major concern is the racial & ethnic breakdown of admitted students, showing significant underrepresentation from black and latinx students. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to elicit which factors predict performance on the SHSAT. These factors will serve as beacons to direct or draw services, whether education-based or otherwise, towards improving the percentage of black and latinx students admitted to the specialized high schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach aims to quantify which variables lead to admissions offers beyond prior proxies: English Language Learners, Students with Disabilities, Students on Free/Reduced Lunch, and Students with Temporary Housing."
